# DDPM schedule configuration
#
# DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) provides:
# - Stochastic sampling (noise added at each step)
# - Full 1000-step inference
# - REQUIRED for MCTS branching (different noise = different branches)
#
# Use this config for MCTS routing. For fast baselines, use ddim.yaml.

  type: "ddpm"

# MCTS-specific configuration

  # Number of branches per node (K-branch expansion)
  # Higher = more exploration, but more compute
